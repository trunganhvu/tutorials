# AI Knowledge Portal Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create an internal knowledge sharing platform for AI concepts, guides, and news
- Enable centralized access to AI-related content for all 50 employees
- Provide secure user authentication and role-based access control
- Support article creation, management, and search functionality
- Implement file storage and sharing capabilities via AWS S3
- Deploy scalable infrastructure using Docker and Kubernetes on AWS

### Background Context
The AI Application startup needs a centralized platform to share AI knowledge across all 50 employees. Currently, knowledge sharing is fragmented across various tools and platforms, making it difficult for employees to find relevant AI-related content, guides, and news. This portal will serve as the single source of truth for internal AI knowledge, enabling better learning, collaboration, and knowledge retention within the organization.

The portal will support two user roles: administrators who can create and manage content, and regular users who can read and search articles. The system will integrate with AWS S3 for file storage and be deployed using modern containerization and orchestration technologies for scalability and maintainability.
