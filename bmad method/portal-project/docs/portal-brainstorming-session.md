- **UI Components**: PrimeVue for consistent, professional UI
- **Routing**: Vue Router with proper navigation guards
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### Infrastructure (AWS + Docker + Kubernetes)
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployments, services, ingress
- **AWS Services**: S3 (file storage), RDS (PostgreSQL), EKS, ALB
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline
- **Load Balancing**: AWS ALB for traffic distribution

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
- **Users**: User accounts, authentication, roles
- **Articles**: Content, metadata, file attachments
- **Files**: S3 file references and metadata
- **Sessions**: JWT session management

### Key Relationships
- Users can have multiple articles (admin only)
- Articles can have multiple file attachments
- One-to-many relationships for proper data normalization

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Development
1. **PM Agent** → Create detailed PRD
2. **Architect Agent** → Design architecture and database schema
3. **Developer Agent** → Implement core features

### Phase 2: AWS Integration
1. **Developer Agent** → Integrate S3 file storage
2. **Developer Agent** → Implement search functionality

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. **Developer Agent** → Docker containerization
2. **Developer Agent** → Kubernetes manifests
3. **Developer Agent** → AWS deployment setup

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

### File Security
- S3 bucket policies for secure file access
- Presigned URLs for file downloads
- File type validation
- Virus scanning for uploaded files

### Infrastructure Security
- Kubernetes RBAC
- Network policies
- Secrets management
- Regular security updates
