# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict Content Security Policy
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization and output encoding
- Secure Storage: HTTP-only cookies for JWT tokens

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP
- CORS Policy: Restricted to frontend domain

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: HTTP-only cookies with secure flag
- Session Management: JWT with short expiration (15 minutes)
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB gzipped
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting and lazy loading
- Caching Strategy: Service worker for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for API calls
- Database Optimization: Proper indexing and query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session and frequently accessed data
