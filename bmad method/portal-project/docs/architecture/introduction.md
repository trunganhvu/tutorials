# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI Knowledge Portal, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Analysis**: Based on the PRD, this is a **greenfield project** with no existing starter template mentioned. The project will be built from scratch using:
- Next.js backend with TypeScript and Prisma
- Vue.js 3 frontend with Vite, PrimeVue, and Pinia
- PostgreSQL database
- AWS infrastructure with Docker and Kubernetes

**Decision**: N/A - Greenfield project
