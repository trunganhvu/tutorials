# Example
In this day and age, opinions are divided on ways/how to solve problems in big cities such as Ha Noi, the capital of Vietnam.  It is widely believed that imposing heavy taxes on private car ownership and allocating the revenue to enhance public transportation represents an effective solution/remedy for Vietnam’s traffic congestion. In this essay, I will explore both the potential merits and the shortcomings associated with this matter/experience

On the one hand, there are many persuasive rationales supporting this idea. First and foremost, the Vietnamese government would have more financial resources from higher car taxes, which may motivate investment to for develop transportation infrastructures. For example, according to Dr. Lee’ s research published in VnEconomy, with the current volume of private cars in Hanoi, a mere 5% tax increase could provide enough funding to expand the bus network.
MoreoverI if the total price to buy a car increases, people will have to reconsider using their money to buy a car, and opt for public transportation instead. 
Therefore/Consequently, the quantity of vehicles on the road might decrease, thereby easing traffic congestion.

On the other hand, despite the idealistic nature of increasing tax on personal automobiles, some severe problems can result from implementing it. To start, most families and individuals would face more difficulties and financial burdens without using a car, because  the cost of owning a car is more expensive.
In the long term, this could have an impact on customer purchasing decisions regarding transportation.
Furthermore, raising car tax may also generate some negative feedback within the society and economy. For example, such a policy may hinder the growth of businesses, which are situated far from the city center and require long commuting time, as fewer people can reach them.

In conclusion, whereas adjusting car tax may lessen traffic jams and discourage citizens from buying private vehicles, it could create obstacles for the development of suburban businesses and lives of general inhabitants. Hence,  the Vietnamese government should analyze carefully and plan thoroughly before implementing it officially.
